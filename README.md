# NHS-R Community metrics

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

As NHS-R Community does not have any formal membership, paid or
otherwise, and people are able to contribute as they are able, we want
to track how many people are participating and actively engaging in
NHS-R Community activities. Content that is shared through YouTube, the
website and Podcasts is extremely popular but does not necessarily
reflect the community which is people and their interactions.

NHS-R Community primarily use a free Slack workspace to discuss and
share, through conversations. Slack provides analytics through a
[dashboard](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218407447-View-your-Slack-analytics-dashboard)
and also provides a [download of
data](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360057638533-Understand-the-data-in-your-Slack-analytics-dashboard).
